# SOP (Service Oriented Programming)
### This project was created for the university subject called Service Oriented Programming. 
- The task was to create either a GRPC or a RESTful application (Nodejs + OpenAPI + optional client). I opted for the RESTful application. For client side, I used C#.
My original idea was to "simulate" a shop, where you were able to buy products, but you needed to log in. As a simple user, you're not able to insert new products, change their price or quantity, or even remove from the list. Those requires a special privilage (being an admin).
#### My plan with this project
- My plan is to make this project as clean as I can (in terms of code).

(It is not the original code what I've shown to the teacher)
